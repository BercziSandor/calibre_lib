### Összefoglalás
<div>
<p>The Python ecosystem is vast and far-reaching in both scope and depth. Starting out in this crazy, open-source forest is daunting, and even with years of experience, it still requires continual effort to keep up-to-date with the best libraries and techniques. This report helps you explore some of the lesser known Python libraries and tools, including third-party modules and several extremely useful tools in the standard library that deserve more attention.<br>What makes this collection different from other lists online? Author Caleb Hattingh diligently spent time finding and testing hidden gems that fit several criteria: easy to install and use, cross-platform, applicable to more than one domain, and not yet popular but likely to become so soon. You will likely discover at least a couple of cool libraries that will assist you in your everyday Python activities, no matter your specialization.</p></div>
