### Összefoglalás
<div>
<p>Learn software engineering and coding best practices to write Python code right and error free. In this book you’ll see how to properly debug, organize, test, and maintain your code, all of which leads to better, more efficient coding.</p>
<p>Software engineering is difficult. Programs of any substantial length are inherently prone to errors of all kinds. The development cycle is full of traps unknown to the apprentice developer. Yet, in Python textbooks little attention is paid to this aspect of getting your code to run. At most, there is a chapter on debugging or unit testing in your average basic Python book. However, the proportion of time spent on getting your code to run is much higher in the real world. <em>Pro Python Best Practices</em> aims to solve this problem.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold">What You'll Learn</p>
<ul><li>Learn common debugging techniques that help you find and eliminate errors </li>
<li>Gain techniques to detect bugs more easily </li></ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold">Who This Book Is For </p>
<p>Experienced Python coders from web development, big data, and more. </p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>“As your Python programs grow, so do your problems: debugging gets harder; the need for well-written tests becomes more urgent; and maintenance issues intrude; bringing the need for a better approach to version control, code organisation, and documentation. Pro Python Best Practices is a neat exploration of all of these topics, which starts by making the case for best practices. … Essential material.” (The MagPi, Issue 59, July, 2017)</p>
