Behind the bitter rivalry between Apple and Google—and how it’s
reshaping the way we think about technologyThe rise of smartphones and
tablets has altered the industry of making computers. At the center of
this change are Apple and Google, two companies whose philosophies,
leaders, and commercial acumen have steamrolled the competition. In the
age of Android and the iPad, these corporations are locked in a feud
that will play out not just in the mobile marketplace but in the courts
and on screens around the world. Fred Vogelstein has reported on this
rivalry for more than a decade and has rare access to its major players.
In Dogfight, he takes us into the offices and board rooms where company
dogma translates into ruthless business; behind outsize personalities
like Steve Jobs, Apple’s now-lionized CEO, and Eric Schmidt, Google’s
executive chairman; and inside the deals, lawsuits, and allegations that
mold the way we communicate. Apple and Google are poaching each other’s
employees. They bid up the price of each other’s acquisitions for spite,
and they forge alliances with major players like Facebook and Microsoft
in pursuit of market dominance. Dogfight reads like a novel: vivid
nonfiction with never-before-heard details. This is more than a story
about what devices will replace our cell phones and laptops. It’s about
who will control the content on those devices and where that content
will come from—about the future of media and the Internet in Silicon
Valley, New York, and Hollywood.
